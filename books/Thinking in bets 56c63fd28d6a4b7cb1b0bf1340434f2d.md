Redefine Right and Wrong - There is more than these two options (shapes of grey)

### Revisit our beliefs

Our default is to believe what we hear and read.

Process of forming beliefs:

1. We hear something
2. We believe it
3. Sometimes we think about it, determining whether or not it is true

We usually stay in the second step.

### Wanna bet?

This statement shows how confident we are in our beliefs.

Rate our beliefs using a scale from 1 to ten instead of using two extremes like right or wrong.

### Self-serving Bias

The idea is that we overestimate our own skills when we have good outcomes and we blame luck when we have bad outcomes, and vice-versa, when others have good outcomes it is due to luck, and when they have bad outcomes they are to blame. To counter this bias we can put our wins in others' shoes.

## Decision-making club

Create a group to evaluate decision-making with individuals who are accountable whose interest is ***accuracy***.

The group has to engage in exploratory thinking containing two characteristics:

- Accountability for accuracy: imagine explaining your decisions to others
- Diversity of perspectives

Question to improve decision making:

- Why might my belief not be true?
- What other evidence we have
- Similar areas I can look toward to gauge whether similar beliefs to mine are true
- What sources of information could I missed or minimized on the way to reaching my belief
- Reason someone else could have a different belief
- What other perspectives there are

### Robert K Merton Rules for decision-making group

- **C**ommunism: data belong to the group
- **U**niversalism: apply uniform standards to claim and evidence
- **D**isinterestedness: vigilance against potential conflicts
- **O**rganized
- **S**kepticism: discussion among the group to encourage engagement and dissent

Coined phrases by Robert K Merton: "role model," "self-fulfilling prophecy," "reference group," "unintended consequences," "focus group"

ðŸ’¡ The **Rashomon** **effect** describes how parties describe an event in a different and contradictory manner, which reflects their subjective interpretation and self-interested advocacy, rather than an objective truth

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Don't discard an idea because It came from someone we don't like. The opposite is true, don't just accept an idea just because it came from someone you like. To counter this bias imagine the idea came from someone we value (if we didn't like the person), or someone we distrust (if we like the person).

### Outcome blindness

Do not tell the outcome before analyzing the data

## Tips

> Have you considered other ways to think about that? - type of question
> 
- Express uncertainty
- Present information as supplementing rather than negating. Use "and" instead of "but"
- Focus on the future and things in our control
- Imaging future conversations about your decisions
- Avoid temporal discounting (favoring our present self at the expense of our future self) by meeting our future self
- Imaging consequences in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years
- Regret before making a decision
- Don't make decisions on Tilt (cycle of bad outcomes â†’ bad emotions â†’ bad decision making â†’ more bad outcomes)
- Diverse viewpoints
- scenario-planning approach

### Decision Swear Jar

Signals of decision interrupt:

- The illusion of certainty: "I know," "I'm sure"
- Overconfidence: similar terms used in the illusion of certainty
- Irrational outcome fielding: "I can't believe how unlucky I got," conclusions of luck, skill, blame, or credit
- Moaning or complaining to get sympathy
- Generalized characterizations of people meant to dismiss their ideas
- Shooting the message because we don't think much of the messenger. Be on guard for the reverse too.
- Zoomed in on a moment out of proportion
- Motivated reasoning: "conventional wisdom"
- Word "wrong"
- Lack of self-compassion: "How could I be so stupid?"
- Generous editors when we share a story
- Infecting our listeners with a conflict of interest
- Terms that discourage engagement of others and their opinions

### Backcasting

Imagine holding up a newspaper whose headlines read "you achieve XYZ." Also do a Premortem, imagine a newspaper whose headline reads "we failed to reach our goal." Why did we fail?

### Hindsight Bias

This bias appears when we analyze the past after the outcome occurred. After one of the possible futures comes to reality, we determine that there was no other way it could happen in a deterministic way.
